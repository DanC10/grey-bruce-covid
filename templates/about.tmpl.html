        <p>Grey Bruce COVID-19 tracker is a tool to keep track of the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in
            the Grey Bruce public health region.
            The data used in this app was acquired from the government of Ontario's website using their CKAN API. This
            can be found here: <a
                href="https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario">https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario</a></a>

        <p>The "Accurate Episode Date" is described by the iPHIS (integrated Public Health Information System) as an
            estimate of the onset date of disease for a case of COVID-19.</p>

            The Accurate Episode Date is an estimate of the onset date of disease for a case. In order to determine
            this date, the following hierarchy is in place in iPHIS:
            <ul>
                <li>Onset Date</li>
                <li>Specimen Collection Date</li>
                <li>Laboratory Test Date</li>
                <li>Reported Date</li>
            </ul>
            If an Onset Date exists, it will be used in place of the Specimen Collection Date followed by the other
            episode dates in the hierarchy; however, the earliest date available at each stage of the hierarchy is
            selected as the Accurate Episode Date. For example, the earlier of two specimen collection dates would
            be selected as the episode accurate date at the second stage of the hierarchy for a case that has two
            specimen collection dates, but no symptom onset date in iPHIS. Episode Date Hierarchy prevents cases
            from being pulled forward in time beyond their Reported Date.
